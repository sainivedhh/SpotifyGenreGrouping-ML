Spotify Songsâ€™ Genre Segmentation &amp; Recommendation System This project uses Spotify dataset audio features to perform clustering and build a simple recommendation system. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering (K-Means), visualization, and a similarity-based recommendation engine.

# Spotify Songs' Genre Segmentation & Recommendation System

## Overview
This project uses Spotify dataset audio features to:
- Perform **data preprocessing** (handle missing values, normalize features).
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and visualization of song characteristics.
- Perform **K-Means clustering** to group songs based on audio features.
- Visualize clusters using **PCA**.
- Build a **recommendation system** that suggests similar songs based on audio features.
